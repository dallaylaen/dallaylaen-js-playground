# Dallaylaen's own JS playground

Nothing to see here, move along. 
Implementing classic algos & trying out new thing. 
Also optimizing & profiling isolated code from leetcode.

## Structure

* `test/` - tests
* `lib/` - useful utilities, may go into modules - who knows?
* `tree/` - tree variants
* `queue.` - queue variants
